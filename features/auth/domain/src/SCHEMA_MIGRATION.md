# Migration from user.schema.ts to user.model.ts

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All imports have been successfully updated to use the new consolidated `user.model.ts` instead of the legacy `user.schema.ts`.

## What Was Changed

### âœ… Updated Imports

All these files now import from `models/user.model.js`:

- `auth.service.ts`
- `auth.module.ts`
- `strategies/google.strategy.ts`
- `strategies/github.strategy.ts`

### âœ… Field Compatibility

- **Database field**: `emailVerified` (matches existing MongoDB documents)
- **Interface compliance**: `isVerified` getter/setter (implements IUser contract)
- **Backward compatibility**: Both field names work in code

### âœ… Legacy File Status

- `schemas/user.schema.ts` is now **deprecated** with clear warning comments
- Export removed from `index.ts` (commented out)
- File can be safely deleted after confirming no external dependencies

## Migration Verification

```typescript
// âœ… OLD (deprecated)
import { User, UserDocument } from './schemas/user.schema.js';

// âœ… NEW (active)
import { User, UserDocument } from './models/user.model.js';
```

## Field Usage Patterns

```typescript
// Both work thanks to getter/setter:
user.emailVerified = true;  // Database field
user.isVerified = true;     // Interface field (maps to emailVerified)

// For new code, prefer the interface field:
if (user.isVerified) { ... }
```

## Next Steps

### Safe to Delete

After verifying no external packages import `schemas/user.schema.ts`, you can:

1. **Delete the file**: `rm schemas/user.schema.ts`
2. **Remove from git**: `git rm schemas/user.schema.ts`

### Benefits Achieved

- âœ… Single source of truth for User structure
- âœ… No more sync issues between schema/entity/DTO
- âœ… GraphQL types automatically generated
- âœ… Validation built into the model
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained

## Rollback (if needed)

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback by:

1. Uncomment exports in `index.ts`
2. Revert imports to use `schemas/user.schema.js`
3. Remove deprecation comment

But this should not be necessary as all functionality has been preserved in the consolidated model.

**Result**: The redundant `user.schema.ts` file you identified has been successfully replaced by the consolidated `user.model.ts` approach! ðŸŽ‰
