## 🎯 Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a no-code document-based data management platform that bridges the gap between traditional spreadsheet thinking and modern document databases. We combine Airtable's user-friendly interface with MongoDB's flexible document structure, empowering business users to manage complex, nested data without technical expertise while giving developers the power of a full document database.

### Key Differentiators
- **Document-First Design**: Native MongoDB document structure support
- **Visual Schema Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for data modeling
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Live editing with conflict resolution
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Complete control over data and infrastructure
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with TypeScript, React, and NestJS
