## ðŸš¨ **Risk Management & Mitigation**

### **High Priority Risks**

#### **Risk 1: MongoDB Complexity Overwhelming Users**
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Start with familiar spreadsheet metaphors
- Implement progressive disclosure of document features
- Create comprehensive onboarding tutorials
- User testing every 2 weeks with non-technical users

#### **Risk 2: Real-Time Performance at Scale**
**Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Performance testing from sprint 1
- WebSocket connection pooling and optimization
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategy early

#### **Risk 3: Integration Complexity in Unified Application**
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Clear separation of concerns within the unified application
